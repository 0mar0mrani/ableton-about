# Ableton About
This is an exercise of coping the [Ableton's 'About'](https://www.ableton.com/en/about/)-section where the goal was to replicate the original website as close as possible. This was built with HTML, CSS and JS. 

See a live demo [here](ableton-copy.netlify.app).

## Features
- Responsive design for all devices with complex change of menu navigation between mobile and desktop. 

## Disclaimer
The project was made for practice purpose only. Images are taken directly from Ableton.
